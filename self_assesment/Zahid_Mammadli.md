# Zahid Mammadli
In this project, my primary role was to develop the core functionality of the application by writing the app.py file. I was responsible for implementing the logic required for CVE lookup, ensuring seamless integration with external databases such as NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB. My work also involved handling the generation of both PDF and HTML reports. I focused on making the application well-structured, efficient, and user-friendly. Additionally, I collaborated closely with my teammates, offering support in troubleshooting and refining their code contributions. My role also extended to maintaining the overall project structure and workflow. This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also allowed me to strengthen my collaborative skills, ensuring that our final product was both robust and met all project requirements.
