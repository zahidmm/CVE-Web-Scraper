In my role as a tester, I was tasked with ensuring the accuracy and reliability of CVE request handling in our Python project. I meticulously designed and executed test cases to verify the correct retrieval, processing, and presentation of CVE data. A critical part of my role involved verifying the functionality of clickable links within the reports, ensuring they were correctly formatted and directed users to the intended sources. I also conducted performance testing to assess the system's efficiency in handling different data loads, addressing any bottlenecks that arose. Through close collaboration with developers, I reported bugs, clarified requirements, and suggested improvements. My contributions significantly enhanced the reliability and usability of our CVE handling system.
