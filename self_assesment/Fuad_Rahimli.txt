In this project, I was responsible for designing and developing the index.html and result.html pages. For the index.html page, I created a simple, dark-themed interface where users could enter CVE IDs, ensuring that it was both responsive and user-friendly. I also incorporated error handling for invalid inputs to enhance user experience. On the result.html page, I focused on organizing the data retrieved from NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB in a clear and structured manner, utilizing lists and tables for easy navigation. Additionally, I added dynamic features like reference links and a button to export the results as a PDF, which significantly improved the functionality and usability of the application.
