# Mammadzada Khaligverdi
As the tester for this project, my role centered on validating the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of CVE request handling in our Python application. I designed and executed comprehensive test cases to ensure the correct retrieval, processing, and display of CVE data. My responsibilities also included verifying that the links generated in the reports were correctly formatted and functional, enhancing the overall usability of the final output. Additionally, I conducted performance testing to evaluate the system's capability to handle varying amounts of CVE data, identifying and resolving potential bottlenecks. My problem-solving skills were key in addressing issues related to data parsing, link formatting, and data integrity, ensuring the robustness of the application.
