# Zahid Mammadli
In this project, my primary role was to develop the core functionality of the application by writing the app.py file. I was responsible for implementing the logic required for CVE lookup, ensuring seamless integration with external databases such as NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB. My work also involved handling the generation of both PDF and HTML reports. I focused on making the application well-structured, efficient, and user-friendly. Additionally, I collaborated closely with my teammates, offering support in troubleshooting and refining their code contributions. My role also extended to maintaining the overall project structure and workflow. This experience not only honed my technical abilities but also allowed me to strengthen my collaborative skills, ensuring that our final product was both robust and met all project requirements.

# Fuad Rahimli
In this project, I was responsible for designing and developing the index.html and result.html pages. For the index.html page, I created a simple, dark-themed interface where users could enter CVE IDs, ensuring that it was both responsive and user-friendly. I also incorporated error handling for invalid inputs to enhance user experience. On the result.html page, I focused on organizing the data retrieved from NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB in a clear and structured manner, utilizing lists and tables for easy navigation. Additionally, I added dynamic features like reference links and a button to export the results as a PDF, which significantly improved the functionality and usability of the application.

# Mammadzada Khaligverdi
As the tester for this project, my role centered on validating the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of CVE request handling in our Python application. I designed and executed comprehensive test cases to ensure the correct retrieval, processing, and display of CVE data. My responsibilities also included verifying that the links generated in the reports were correctly formatted and functional, enhancing the overall usability of the final output. Additionally, I conducted performance testing to evaluate the system's capability to handle varying amounts of CVE data, identifying and resolving potential bottlenecks. My problem-solving skills were key in addressing issues related to data parsing, link formatting, and data integrity, ensuring the robustness of the application.

# Natiq Mammadli
In my role as a tester, I was tasked with ensuring the accuracy and reliability of CVE request handling in our Python project. I meticulously designed and executed test cases to verify the correct retrieval, processing, and presentation of CVE data. A critical part of my role involved verifying the functionality of clickable links within the reports, ensuring they were correctly formatted and directed users to the intended sources. I also conducted performance testing to assess the system's efficiency in handling different data loads, addressing any bottlenecks that arose. Through close collaboration with developers, I reported bugs, clarified requirements, and suggested improvements. My contributions significantly enhanced the reliability and usability of our CVE handling system.
