# Zahid Mammadli
In this project, I was primarily responsible for developing the core functionality of the application by writing the app.py file. This involved implementing the logic for CVE lookup, integrating with NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB, and handling the generation of PDF and HTML reports. I ensured that the application was well-structured, efficient, and user-friendly.
I worked closely with my teammates, offering support in troubleshooting and refining their code contributions, and helped maintain the overall project structure and workflow. My involvement in the project not only enhanced my technical skills but also allowed me to collaborate effectively within the team, ensuring that our final product was robust and met all requirements.
