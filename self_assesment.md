In this project, I was primarily responsible for developing the core functionality of the application by writing the app.py file. This involved implementing the logic for CVE lookup, integrating with NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB, and handling the generation of PDF and HTML reports. I ensured that the application was well-structured, efficient, and user-friendly.
I worked closely with my teammates, offering support in troubleshooting and refining their code contributions, and helped maintain the overall project structure and workflow. My involvement in the project not only enhanced my technical skills but also allowed me to collaborate effectively within the team, ensuring that our final product was robust and met all requirements.

For this project, I worked on the index.html and result.html pages. Here's what I contributed:

Built the index.html page where users can enter CVE IDs. I kept the design simple, with a dark theme, making sure it’s responsive and user-friendly. I also added error handling for invalid inputs​(index).
For result.html, I laid out the results clearly, pulling data from NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB. I used lists and tables to keep everything organized and easy to follow​(result).
Added useful features like dynamic reference links and a button to export the results as a PDF​(result).
