# CVE Lookup & Report Generator

This Flask-based web application allows users to search for specific CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) IDs and fetch information from multiple sources including NIST, MITRE, and Exploit DB. The application can also generate and export detailed reports in PDF and HTML formats.

## Features

- **CVE Lookup**: Validate and search for CVE information by ID.
- **NIST Integration**: Fetch detailed CVE descriptions, scores, vectors, and references from NIST.
- **MITRE Integration**: Retrieve additional metadata, including assigner details, descriptions, references, and affected products.
- **Exploit DB Integration**: Scrape verified exploit data linked to specific CVEs.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Export the fetched data into a neatly formatted PDF report.
- **HTML Report Generation**: Export the fetched data into a neatly formatted HTML report.
- **Headless Scraping**: Uses Selenium with headless Chrome for fast and seamless scraping.
- **Automatic reference opening**: Automatically opens up to 5 reference links for each CVE.
